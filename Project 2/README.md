FYS-STK4155 Project 2

In this file is the codes used in Project 2 for the subject FYS-STK4155. 
Here is a short description of what you will find:

Credit_Card_Data.py: Here the credit card data is analysed and all the plots that are found in the pdf-file are produced here. 
This file uses other files with codes as hypertuning.py, Weight.py and NeuralNetwork.py

Franke_NN.py: Here the Franke function is analysed and all the plots that are found in the pdf-file are produced here.
This file uses other files with codes as hypertuning.py, Misc.py and NeuralNetwork.py

Misc.py: All the functions that are used in analysing Franke but not necessarily needs to be in Franke_NN.py. Some of these functions might be good to use in some other problems and are quite general: shuffle() and backshuffle().

NeuralNetwork.py: Here is the Neural Network which is made to work for both Franke and the Credit Card data. 

Weight.py: Includes the class Weight which are all the gradient descent methods used in logistic regression when analysing the Credit Card data. 

hypertuning.py: Hypertuning function for Franke and for Credit Card data. 

default of credit card clients.xls: The actual Credit Card data used for this project. 

Project2.pdf: The report written for this project.
